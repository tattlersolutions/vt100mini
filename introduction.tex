\chapter{Introduction}

The VT132 terminal module is an RC2014 compliant module which makes it possible to use a RC2014 as a stand-alone computer
as it provides keyboard input and VGA display output.

It also provides WiFi modem emulation which enables the use of a terminal program (like Kermit or QTerm on CP/M) for
transferring data, controlling a remote computer or logging into a BBS.

This Quick Reference Guide lists the options and commands needed for everyday use of the VT132.
