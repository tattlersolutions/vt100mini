\chapter{Firmware Updates}

\section{Over-the-Air Updates}

To update the firmware of the VT132 to the latest version, a OTA update function is implemented via modem
AT commands (see also in section \vref{modemota}).

You can use a terminal program like QTERM or KERMIT or use the LOCAL mode and talk directly to the modem, see
section \vref{quicksettings} for the \textit{Quick Settings Menu}. 

To get the latest official version, which is hosted on GitHub, use the following AT commands and steps:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em]
 \item \texttt{AT+W+} or \texttt{AT+W=}\textit{ssid}\texttt{,}\textit{pwd} to join your Wi-Fi network
 \item \texttt{AT+U\$} to see what firmware version you are currently running \textit{(optional)}
 \item \texttt{AT+U?} to query GitHub for the latest firmware image (essential!)
 \item The answer shows the version number and an indicator to tell if the version found online is
	[OLDER], [SAME] or [NEWER] than the currently installed version
 \item \texttt{AT+U\textasciicircum} to perform the upgrade to the newer version
 \item \textit{Alternatively:} \texttt{AT+U!} to force the upgrade, if the version found online is
	older or the same
 \item During the process of downloading and installing, dots will be output to indicate progress until OK shows
	that it is finished
 \item Use \texttt{AT+U\$} to see what version will be run after the reset \textit{(optional)}
 \item Perform a hardware reset or power cycle to start the new version
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Please note:}

Once you have entered the Query OTA Update command \texttt{AT+U?} the VT132 should not be expected to operate "normally"
until you perform a hardware reset or reboot of the VT132.\\
This is because the Query OTA Update command opens and creates a number of files and large data structures in memory
that may conflict with normal operation and these can only be closed and released by a hardware reset or reboot.

\textbf{Security notes:}

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em]
 \item OTA Updates from GitHub are performed using the HTTPS protocol.
 \item Security certificates (Root CA) for GitHub and Amazon S3 (where GitHub stores release binary files) are embedded in the firmware.
 \item HTTPS requests to servers that use any other Root CA certificate will fail to authenticate.
 \item The VT132 makes this request as an https client and does not implement an http or https server.
\end{itemize}

% TODO: need official documentation on this part
%\section{Updates from local server}
%
%To use a local web server to store firmware updates, you can use \texttt{AT+U=}\textit{url} to specify
%another URL which the VT132 will query for new firmware releases.
