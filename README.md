# VT132-QuickRef

This document aims to provide a Quick Reference Guide for the VT132 terminal/modem module for RC2014-style
computers.

This is a LaTeX document, so a working LaTeX installation is needed to compile it.

A compiled version is available as ```vt132.pdf```.

To edit the document in the LaTeX editor Kile, a kile project file (```vt132.kilepr```) is provided.

To compile the file, just run ```xelatex vt132.tex``` (2 times to get the references right) and you get the ```.pdf``` file (or call ```make.sh```).

The script ```clean.sh``` can be used to remove all intermediate files.

The Debian/Ubuntu package ```texlive-fonts-extra``` (besides ```texlive``` as the base TeXlive package) is needed to provide the font "Linux Libertine".
